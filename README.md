# phpBB 3.3 Extension - phpBB Wall

## About

This is a extension made in 2017 and that hasn't been updated since then.

I just updated some files to make the extension compatible with the phpBB 3.3.x version, and fixed the issue of not being able to send images.
I'm not experienced into create or modify extension, so I hope someone can fix few of the issues that this extension has.

From my testing, almost everything is working, but I'm having few issues that need to be addressed;

* Cannot see other player's wall content
* Cannot post on other player's wall
* Can't delete posted images
* Add friends through wall is not working properly
